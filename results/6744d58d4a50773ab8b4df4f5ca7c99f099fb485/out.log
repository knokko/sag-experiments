The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.008.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T1J16 must be dispatched before T19J193
 - ensure that T15J152 must be dispatched before T0J2
 - ensure that T12J120 must be dispatched before T19J190
 - ensure that T15J151 must be dispatched before T20J195
 - ensure that T8J80 must be dispatched before T21J200
 - ensure that T27J230 must be dispatched before T31J250
 - ensure that T15J156 must be dispatched before T0J6
 - ensure that T23J213 must be dispatched before T40J269
 - ensure that T1J12 must be dispatched before T19J191
