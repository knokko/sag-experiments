The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.004.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...
