The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.008.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T10J100 must be dispatched before T15J125
 - ensure that T1J10 must be dispatched before T10J100
 - ensure that T0J7 must be dispatched before T29J154
