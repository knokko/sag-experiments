The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.012.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

12 remain after trial & error.
The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T6J74 must be dispatched before T0J2
 - ensure that T1J14 must be dispatched before T23J166
 - ensure that T9J112 must be dispatched before T15J141
 - ensure that T7J90 must be dispatched before T10J122
 - ensure that T8J96 must be dispatched before T7J84
 - ensure that T9J108 must be dispatched before T8J96
 - ensure that T7J93 must be dispatched before T10J123
 - ensure that T7J84 must be dispatched before T10J120
 - ensure that T11J124 must be dispatched before T9J110
 - ensure that T1J15 must be dispatched before T10J121
 - ensure that T6J73 must be dispatched before T17J148
 - ensure that T6J75 must be dispatched before T0J3
