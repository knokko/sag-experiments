The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.004.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T13J131 must be dispatched before T29J250
 - ensure that T13J133 must be dispatched before T33J256
 - ensure that T25J242 must be dispatched before T31J254
 - ensure that T1J15 must be dispatched before T15J155
 - ensure that T13J135 must be dispatched before T24J241
