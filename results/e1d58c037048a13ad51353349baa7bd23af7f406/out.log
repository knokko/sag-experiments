The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.104.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.

 increased #extra constraints to 11
11 dispatch ordering constraints were added, let's try to minimize that...
11 remain after transitivity analysis; let's minimize further using tail trial-and-error...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T1J8 must be dispatched before T13J104
 - ensure that T14J106 must be dispatched before T26J130
