The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.004.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T1J30 must be dispatched before T12J182
 - ensure that T9J167 must be dispatched before T15J197
 - ensure that T1J33 must be dispatched before T19J213
 - ensure that T1J22 must be dispatched before T23J227
 - ensure that T1J20 must be dispatched before T8J160
 - ensure that T14J191 must be dispatched before T29J245
 - ensure that T1J31 must be dispatched before T17J205
 - ensure that T1J21 must be dispatched before T14J190
 - ensure that T4J98 must be dispatched before T24J234
 - ensure that T14J190 must be dispatched before T17J203
 - ensure that T1J38 must be dispatched before T27J242
 - ensure that T27J242 must be dispatched before T8J164
 - ensure that T1J32 must be dispatched before T22J225
 - ensure that T1J29 must be dispatched before T8J162
 - ensure that T1J27 must be dispatched before T15J196
