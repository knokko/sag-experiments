The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.044.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T13J52 must be dispatched before T1J4
 - ensure that T1J4 must be dispatched before T11J44
 - ensure that T11J44 must be dispatched before T22J88
