The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.156.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T17J100 must be dispatched before T32J142
 - ensure that T12J75 must be dispatched before T0J3
 - ensure that T0J1 must be dispatched before T20J112
 - ensure that T8J49 must be dispatched before T33J143
 - ensure that T25J132 must be dispatched before T26J136
 - ensure that T32J142 must be dispatched before T2J13
 - ensure that T10J61 must be dispatched before T15J91
