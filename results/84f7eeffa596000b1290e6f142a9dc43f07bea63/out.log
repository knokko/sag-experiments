The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.004.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T4J19 must be dispatched before T11J43
 - ensure that T5J23 must be dispatched before T14J49
 - ensure that T23J66 must be dispatched before T7J28
 - ensure that T13J47 must be dispatched before T28J71
 - ensure that T1J4 must be dispatched before T10J40
 - ensure that T24J67 must be dispatched before T10J41
 - ensure that T22J65 must be dispatched before T30J73
 - ensure that T20J61 must be dispatched before T15J51
 - ensure that T6J27 must be dispatched before T13J47
 - ensure that T0J2 must be dispatched before T31J74
 - ensure that T30J73 must be dispatched before T21J63
 - ensure that T32J75 must be dispatched before T12J45
 - ensure that T1J6 must be dispatched before T34J77
 - ensure that T34J77 must be dispatched before T25J68
 - ensure that T39J82 must be dispatched before T26J69
 - ensure that T28J71 must be dispatched before T4J19
 - ensure that T21J63 must be dispatched before T0J3
 - ensure that T16J53 must be dispatched before T2J11
 - ensure that T1J5 must be dispatched before T39J82
 - ensure that T17J55 must be dispatched before T3J15
 - ensure that T11J42 must be dispatched before T1J5
