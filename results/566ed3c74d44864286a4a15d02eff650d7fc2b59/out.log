The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.004.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T8J98 must be dispatched before T10J122
 - ensure that T18J219 must be dispatched before T0J3
 - ensure that T18J218 must be dispatched before T4J50
 - ensure that T1J14 must be dispatched before T33J330
 - ensure that T4J50 must be dispatched before T8J98
 - ensure that T16J193 must be dispatched before T5J61
 - ensure that T16J194 must be dispatched before T5J62
 - ensure that T12J146 must be dispatched before T6J74
 - ensure that T1J13 must be dispatched before T27J324
 - ensure that T10J122 must be dispatched before T12J146
