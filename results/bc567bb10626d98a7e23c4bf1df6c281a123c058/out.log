The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.292.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Time to make cuts...
 increased #extra constraints to 10
10 dispatch ordering constraints were added, let's try to minimize that...
10 remain after transitivity analysis; let's minimize further using tail trial-and-error...
 reduced #extra constraints to 9
 reduced #extra constraints to 8
 reduced #extra constraints to 7

1 remain after trial & error.
The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T1J9 must be dispatched before T13J117
