The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.504.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T33J62 must be dispatched before T21J42
 - ensure that T19J39 must be dispatched before T37J66
 - ensure that T20J40 must be dispatched before T38J67
