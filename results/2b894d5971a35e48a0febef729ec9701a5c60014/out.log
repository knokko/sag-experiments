The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.004.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T12J24 must be dispatched before T0J0
 - ensure that T14J29 must be dispatched before T0J1
 - ensure that T37J62 must be dispatched before T36J61
 - ensure that T13J26 must be dispatched before T3J6
 - ensure that T18J36 must be dispatched before T4J8
 - ensure that T44J69 must be dispatched before T5J10
 - ensure that T43J68 must be dispatched before T37J62
 - ensure that T23J47 must be dispatched before T11J23
 - ensure that T12J25 must be dispatched before T39J64
 - ensure that T24J48 must be dispatched before T40J65
