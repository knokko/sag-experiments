The given problem seems to be unschedulable using our scheduler, and the rating of the root node is 0.012.
The problem passed the necessary load-based feasibility test.
The problem passed the necessary interval-based feasibility test.
Since the root node is unsafe, I will need to create a safe job ordering from scratch, which may take seconds or centuries...
You should press Control + C if you run out of patience!
I found a safe job ordering!
Time to make cuts...

The given problem seems to be unschedulable (using our scheduler), but you can make it certainly schedulable by adding all the following dispatch ordering constraints:
 - ensure that T29J128 must be dispatched before T31J134
 - ensure that T9J57 must be dispatched before T10J62
 - ensure that T6J36 must be dispatched before T18J92
 - ensure that T18J92 must be dispatched before T19J96
 - ensure that T11J66 must be dispatched before T31J135
 - ensure that T19J96 must be dispatched before T21J104
